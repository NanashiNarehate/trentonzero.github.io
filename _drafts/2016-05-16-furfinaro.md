It's cold here in the dungeon; cold and lonely.

<!-- more -->

Liswamirë is gone. Having become a wispy shadow of herself, she has been carried off on a tempest. It occurred to her that she commanded the wind by virtue of years of study. And the wind, having caught her, tosses her about as a plaything. She has also left the services of Ainofirinna, preferring the whispers from the desert. 

Ainofirinna is not pleased with me either. Good and faithful servant I am not. I do not hear the desert whispering, but the moon sits serene, and I have to confess she tempts me. But, I won't answer that. I threw my lot in with Ainofirinna, and I know he has gone deeper and higher still.

So, I sit in the dungeon.

Oraverial visits sometimes, not as often as before, and peeks through the bars, and we will talk. She brought new clothes for me a few weeks ago. She is unhelpful most times, but that was one of her better moments. She said "You may be in prison, having fallen out of favor with your inscrutable lord, but prison rags don't suit you. Here is something better. When you are free, you can dress in rags. While you are chained, it's better to dress like a lord. There is a poetry to these things, and the proper forms should be obeyed."

That was weeks ago, as I said, but I have to admit I think it was good advice. At the time though, I caught on a word. 

"You said 'your Lord.' Isn't he yours as well?"

"Ainofirianno? No. Once, he might have been, but Isil gives me a bigger cage and her followers suit me better. I'm with the moon, Vanyanan, and I think you know it, however hard you try to feign shock."

Yes, I did, though I try to avoid thinking about it. I am thinking, I'm not so sure Isil gives Oraverial a larger cell. She offered her creed that prisoners should dress like Lords and free men like prisoners. And I never ever known anyone, of either sex, to dress as extravagantly as Oraverial. But I didn't mention this to her. A religious argument with one of my few friends was not a good policy.

My two servants remain with me as well. That I have lost Ainofirinna's favour, they don't understand, or, having understood, remain faithful out of some higher code. But they dislike the darkness. And distrust my visitors more. I'm not sure they know about Liswamirë and the tempest either. 

I mentioned visitors. 

Calemorinna is the main one. She serves Ainofirinna as well. She is also out of favor, though I'm not sure she knows it. She once admired the moon as well, and went much further into her mysteries then I ever did. 

And I think Calemorinna fears the moon and holds her in too much awe now. I should inquire with Oraverial about it. She will be better acquainted with Isil's mysteries, I suppose, being one of her faithful. Maybe she can tell if Calemorinna's fears are over reaction or greater wisdom. Or if she becomes defensive, maybe I can tell from her reaction. Or maybe I'll get no reaction at all. Are all Isil's faithful so....Scatterbrained? 

Calemorinna visits every few weeks, and she and optimistic that she can help secure my pardon. I'm not so optimistic.

The tempest is larger now. I can hear the wind, even here. I'm not sure Liswamirë knows what she did. Winds are complex things. She can barely handle her little zypher. But I think other things have changed as well, old things, long taken for granted have been ripped up root and all.

I can hear jeering outside, and Ainofirinna be praised, I think maybe it is safer here in the dungeon. It seems impossible, even crazy, but something very big and very... wrong came into this world with Liswamirë's tempest. The winds connect in strange ways at the corners of the world. 

The jeering is louder, and there is a name in their cries, a new god to replace the old ones: Furfinaro.
