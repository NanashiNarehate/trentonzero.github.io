A passion of mine these past few months have been a new breed of tabletop role-playing games known as 'story games'. It's an imprecise term, but speaking very broadly, these are role-playing games where the story takes precedence over both efforts to realistically simulate a world and over win-lose considerations.

But before we get into that, what is a tabletop, pen-and-paper, role-playing game? Pardon my rough and ready definition, but I'm going to say a role-playing game is one where play emphasizes putting yourself in the shoes of a character and following them through a story.
