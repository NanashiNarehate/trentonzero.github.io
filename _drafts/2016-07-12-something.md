A lot has happened in the world of Vanyanan since I last wrote. Calemorrinna is here, and the two households have been joined. My servant Alassë is anything but alassenen. She is faithful as always, and after great difficulty accepted Calemorrinna. But she has not at all accepted Turë or Yara. Despite constant effort, she isn't any closer to accepting. And Turë has had enough...

But let's skip the unpleasantness. Life is going on, whether the little ones get along with one another or not. Calemorrinna is driven to turn my dilapidated fortress into a bright and happy home. Turë and Alassë have their own ideas about that, but it is a pleasant change to have a bathroom floor that isn't crumbling and a stone path in the front yard and even a garden. Really, a garden? How is that going to stand up when the time comes to resist the next horde? It's almost as if we hadn't spent the past year with the Calloléra. The followers of Yelloturë are everywhere, and where they are not, there are the devotees of Lumna, and as their pitched battle reached its conclusion, neither was overly pleased with those fighting with the Calloléra. I haven't written since the battle. Yelloturë is now cáno, or will be soon enough, and everyone tries to pretend this is normal.

Did I become unpleasant again? Sorry. "What a disagreeable old man I have become!" 

We did succeed in putting in new bathroom floor tile, a new toilet, and some decorative wall tile. Calemorrinna did most of the work, though I helped where I could. I helped enough to throw out my back, ruin a pair of pants (that was practically already ruined anyway), and be about the way you expect a lazy computer programmer to be when trying to install subfloor, lay floor tile, grout tile, and so forth. Circular saws and jigsaws and visions of limbs severed at the hightest joint haunt my nightmares now. As if my nightmares weren't bad enough.
