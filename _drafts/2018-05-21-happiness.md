I have a question for you. I don't know who you are, or how many you are, but I'll ask it anyway, seeing as how it is my blog. What makes you happy? Do you know what makes you happy? 

<!-- more -->

I think most people probably do, but I don't. At least, not recently, with recently defined as the last six years or so. Maybe longer.

I'm building up quite the list of things that don't make me happy. Indeed, technology in the 20th century has proved very, very good at eliminating acute unhappiness sources. Texas has 110 degree heat, and engineers gave us air conditioning. But, eliminating unhappiness sources doesn't leave happiness.

Air conditioning is the great example. I'll be the first to praise the glories of air conditioning, but it does mean we lost something from the generation of my grandparents: porch culture: that is, that the thing to do on a pleasant Saturday morning, or a cool Thursday evening, is to sit out on the porch, sip iced tea, and talk over the day's events.

One of the great shocks of our time is partisanship. We feel that we live in an age of fierce and ugly partisanship to rival all others, but that's not true at all. Read any old book and you'll discover that partisans are not new, but we've lost a way of dealing with it. When everyone knew the neighborhood Republican or the Democrat around the corner, the vitriol seemed less scary. Now, one gets the impression, talking to most Democrats, that they don't know, or don't talk to, any Republicans, and vice versa.

Somehow this turned to politics. I miss sitting out on the porch with grandma. Playing dominoes with the kind old man next door whose name escapes me. So why don't I sit outside? Sip tea or coffee and talk lazily while watching the world go around? I don't know. I wake up in the morning and go to the computer. I can see the world outside my door plainly enough, but I need a sophist from across the continent to tell me whats out there. Not because I decided I did, I just act like I do.

My TV doesn't make me happy, that's why I gave it away. Gave it away, and didn't replace it with Netflix or Hulu or anything comparable. You think I'm boasting and maybe I am a little, but I don't mean to. But I sit, and I watch the thing, and I forget myself for hours, then suddenly I become aware of myself and I feel horrible. The same is true for video games, and lazy web browsing, the web browsing where you aren't actually looking for anything but just filling the hours wandering Wikipedia, reading the latest in Atlantic, National Review, the bloggers.

I haven't the courage to do the same to the computer yet, but it might be next. That's a frightening step for a man in my profession. May as well ask a mechanic to do away with his socket wrench, because he's acquired a bad habit of killing himself staring at it. That particular minor addiction of mine I could need at any moment for my livelihood.

That particular addiction of mine always gives me one of my pleasurable activities, the juvenile pleasure of rambling into a blog. I could write it in a book, but then you, whoever you are, however many you are, don't see it, where's the fun in that? May as well think it to myself and spare my hands the trouble of writing it. For all I know, you are nobody, and your how many is 0. That's the most probable answer, actually. But maybe you aren't zero, maybe you aren't nobody? Maybe you read my bad poetry and laugh at me? Maybe you read my bad philosophy and laugh harder? Good.

I'm always a little bit surprised and stunned when I discover that someone took something I wrote seriously. I mean everything I say, but I mean it the way an old man sitting on a porch, sipping iced tea, and filling the hours with his thoughts means it. I've never regretted anything I've said. I've cringed, but I haven't regretted it, except in those cases where I really did try to be serious. Like when I tried to get everybody to vote for Gary Johnson. I went hoarse on that one, and what good did it do? 

But I don't for minute regret turning Trump into Yelloture, my ex-wife's betrayal into an alternative mythology of original sin, and the libertarian party into something like the knights from the role-playing game Polaris, that I don't regret, and I meant ever word, but heaven help me if anyone took it seriously.

Here's another one for the faceless you, assuming you are a Southerner, which I might as well assume that, how should a Southerner feel about the South, today and now? I need someone to explain to me how exactly I go about saying "I love Texas" without someone hearing "I hate black people." I can't really figure that one out. It's like having an uncle that you love dearly, and then you find out that he used to beat his ex-wife. Is there no option but the excommunication and the purge? That is how I feel about Texas. I can neither renouce the charges, nor join whole-heartedly in the denunciations. I never visited the statue of Robert E Lee, never really intended to, didn't really know it was there sitting in Dallas.
