## The Role of Work

What is the role of work in life? 

Let's start by describing some imaginary people, and of course these imaginary people are exaggerations on themes:

### Alfred The Card Puncher 

> Alfred sees work entirely as a means to an end. Life really consists of his family, his time fishing by the lake, and his friends at the bar. He works hard, but leaves work entirely behind when he goes home for the day.  If he is laid off, for Alfred, the only concern is to find a replacement income. If he wins the lottery, he dreams of the day when he can cease work and spend all his time with family, fishing, and at the bar. If he is a Republican, it is because he sees the Democrats as nannies, and if he is a Democrat, it is because he sees the Republicans as on the side of his employers.

### Tony the Hustler

> Tony is a hustler. He does not identify with his work, but he does identify with his success at work. Like Alfred, he largely works for money, but unlike Alfred, his goal is money not because of the lifestyle it buys him, but because of the signal of success it allows him to project. The Alec Baldwin Glengarry Glenrose speech plays a role like a credo in his life. If he is a Democrat, he is a machine politician offering hope to the proleteriat but ensuring he gets a C-suite job at the new buearacracy formed to deliver the crumbs of that hope. If he is a Republican, it is because the left wing message of equality and redistribution fundamentally offends the status seeking part that drives him.
