## The Role of Work

What is the role of work in life? 

Let's start by describing some people, and of course these imaginary people are exaggerations on themes. You will find these types in every job, but in different ratios. You will find any profession with substantial bonuses and commissions dominated by Tonys and every entry-level job by Alfreds. Whereever salaries are paid, you will find Martha and Rachael together.

### Alfred The Card Puncher 

> Alfred sees work entirely as a means to an end. Life really consists of his family, his time fishing by the lake, and his friends at the bar. He works hard, but leaves work entirely behind when he goes home for the day.  If he is laid off, for Alfred, the only concern is to find a replacement income. If he wins the lottery, he dreams of the day when he can cease work and spend all his time with family, fishing, and at the bar. If he is a Republican, it is because he sees the Democrats as nannies, and if he is a Democrat, it is because he sees the Republicans as on the side of his employers. To Alfred, Tony is a crook, Rachael is incomprehensible, and Martha "just works too much."

### Tony the Hustler

> Tony does not identify with his work, but he does identify with his success at work. Like Alfred, he largely works for money, but unlike Alfred, his goal is money not because of the lifestyle it buys him, but because of the signal of success it allows him to project. The Alec Baldwin "Glengarry Glenrose" speech plays a role like a credo in his life. If he is a Democrat, he is a machine politician offering hope to the proleteriat but ensuring he gets a C-suite job at the new bureaucracy formed to deliver the crumbs of that hope. If he is a Republican, it is because the left wing message of equality and redistribution fundamentally offends the status seeking that drives him. Tony is disgusted by Alfred, thinks Martha is hardworking but dumb, and finds Rachael intolerable.

### Martha the Workaholic

> Martha lives for her work. For Martha, work fills a void. Whatever else she has in her life, she prefers her work to it. She may have a family, a church, pets, but if she has a hobby, it is only because she is waged and therefore has statuatory limits to how much work she can do in a week.  If she is a Democrat, it is because the Marxist slogan "From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs" so adaquately describes her life that it does not occur to her that anyone could disagree with it. If she is a Republican, it is because she thinks everyone else is shiftless and lazy. She respects Tony and Rachael, but that feeling is not at all mutual.

### Rachael the Professional

> Rachael also lives for her work, but unlike Martha, it is out of a surplus rather than to fill a void. Rachael has identified a thing that is her "calling" in life. She will say things like "I would do this for free," and she may even feel guilty about her pay. The way to distinguish Rachael from Martha is that Martha will do anything ethical for 60 hours a week. Rachael may work 60 hour weeks, but if she were not able to work within her calling, she would be a lousy employee for 40 hours a week, and persue her profession at home for another 40. Rachael, like Tony, views Martha as unintelligent, views Tony as a crook (just like Alfred), and identifies most easily with Alfred. Rachael and Alfred are both seeking the good life, but Rachael's good life is a profession while Alfred's is personal. If Rachael is a Democrat, it is because she supports Alfred in his goal of living the good life, just as she lives the good life. She may even harbor the idea that Alfred is really just like her, and given sufficient leisure, would discover his profession. If Rachael is a Republican, it is because she is offended and confused by left-wing talk of exploitation. Rachael does what she loves, and more money than could ever be needed just seems to fall from the skies.
