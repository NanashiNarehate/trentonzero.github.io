<p>This will be the dev blog for 'Let It Rain,' my entry in <a href="http://slick.cokeandcode.com/index.php?entry=entry110310-130445">Slick Competition 2011</a>. I came up with the title in a rush, because I didn't want to be locked out of the comp for late entry. So, I might change it later, but I'm going to stand by my choice of theme. The options were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magicka</li>
<li>Rain</li>
<li>Android are not always friends of mine</li>
<li>Devil</li>
<li>The sky is falling</li>
</ul>
<p>Put bluntly, 'Rain' seemed to be the red-headed step-child of the lot, so that's what I went with.</p>
<p>I wrote down about a dozen different ideas, but only one of them really came together in my mind for how it would work as a game. The player must defend his base from a mutant army of carnivorous plants created by a mad scientist. The plants spawn wherever rain falls, and rain clouds will be visible on the map. So some of the game will be maintaining a network of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding" target="_blank">cloud seeding</a> towers to ensure that the rain falls (and enemies spawn) where the player wants and not, say, right in the middle of the base. I'll probably add a few other weather control towers for the player, but it's the cloud seeding tower that I thought of first (wind towers? 'dehumidifier towers'? I need to do some meteorology research!)</p>
<p>So, yeah, it's a tower defense game. But I've never seen a tower defense game where the focus was more about controlling enemy spawning than just creating an efficient grid to blast with, so let's see how it works out.</p>
