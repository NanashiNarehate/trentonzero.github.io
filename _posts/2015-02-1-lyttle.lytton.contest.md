The [Lyttle Lytton Contest](http://adamcadre.ac/lyttle.html)  is a bad short fiction contest organized by Adam Cadre. Yes, the same Adam Cadre that wrote Photopia, Shrapnel, 9:05, etc etc. 

The purpose is, write a plausible beginning to an unintentionally bad novel. For example, this winner of the 2012 contest:

"Agent Jeffreyâ€™s trained eyes rolled carefully around the room, taking in the sights and sounds."

Or this one from 2006: 

"His eyes were brown, although you wouldn't know it just by looking."

Below the jump are two of my own entries.

<!-- more -->

"Jake smelled the bittersweet smell of butternut and knew it was Tuesday; but his olfactory resources had lied to him. Susan was dead."

"He had it all. Money. Power. Success. But he would have traded it all for the love of a shy yet assertive bookworm named Rachel."
