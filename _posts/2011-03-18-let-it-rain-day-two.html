<p>Got to spend a bit more time working this time. Again, attached is a time lapse video of the day's development hosted on YouTube. I'd keep working, but I need to get ready for a church function tonight. Maybe I can do a bit more tonight, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>So, more work on clouds. Better cloud generation.  There are now a few cloud shape algorithms (TALL, LONG, DISPERSED,  SQUARE, TIGHT).</p>
<p>The clouds rain now, though I'm not very happy with how the graphics of rain look.</p>
<p>They also change size dynamically. I was worried it would look artificial, but I'm very pleased with how it looks. The growing and shrinking looks quite reasonably organic given the simplistic way the clouds are being drawn. In fact, I'm pleased with how the clouds look overall. I think the only improvement I should make before going on to other aspects of the program (besides the look of the rain..grrr...) is to enter a random rotation to each 'wisp' of cloud when the whole cloud is built. This will make the cloud look a little more organic and chaotic (since each wisp is more or less a square.)</p>
<p>I tried to make a video of the clouds, but Slick didn't get along very well with Quicktime's screen recorder (1000+ fps down to 15).</p>
