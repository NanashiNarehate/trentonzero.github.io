So, two nights ago I watched the famous "My Dinner with André" for the second time and, with at least two viewings under my belt, I feel confident to write down some thoughts. Just a fair warning, I'm going to assume you've seen the movie, or don't care about seeing it. So, spoiler alert. Though I'm not 100% sure I can really spoil the movie, I could possibly taint your first viewing. Better than you see it at least once and decide what you think before you read. 

If you just come baldly out and say it, "My Dinner with André" is a movie about two guys, who had not seen each other in years, having a conversation together over dinner. The movie begins with one of them, Wallace, taking the subway to the restaurant. It ends with Wallace taking the taxi home. And the subject of the movie is there meal and their conversation during the meal. 

There is no catch, there is no hook.

There is a denouement, but it is the climax of the conversation, which turns gradually into a polite argument (more on that later).

This either sounds tremendously boring to you or...well, okay the way I introduced it, it just sounds tremendously boring. This is basically a "movie about nothing."

Of course, you know where I'm going with that phrase. There is a famous TV show that boasts that it is about nothing, and it's among the most interesting and entertaining shows on television. And much of what lends the show entertainment is the conversations that occur between the characters, far more than the situations themselves. I would pay admission, repeatedly, to hear a feature length conversation between George Kastanza and Jerry Seinfeld, and be certain I would get my money's worth. And, of course, it wasn't really "about nothing" in the most obvious usage of that phrase. 

There is a lot in common between Seinfeld and "My Dinner with André." But, "My Dinner with André" is not a comedy.  It has funny moments, but they occur about as often as funny moments occur in any good conversation, and bits of the conversation are, at least on the surface, very serious.

You will, depending upon your disposition, quite possibly find the first half of the movie highly infuriating. That's okay. At least, I think it's okay, because that is how I responded. But I am getting ahead of myself. 

Wallace and André meet for dinner and Wallace (played by Wallace Shawn, who you probably know as Vizzini the Sicilian from The Princess Bride) is dreading the meeting. Long story short, he has a hard enough life without dealing with André who has acquired a reputation for being a little bit, well, weird. He resolves to get through the dinner with polite nothings. "Oh, that's interesting, tell me more." "Oh really? What was that like?" "Wow, how interesting!" 

That sort of thing. 

For this reason, the first half of the meal and the movie consists of André talking almost non-stop. It starts with the story of a bizarre actors' workshop André conducted in Poland. (André is a theatre director.) But it quickly progesses into André describing the finer points of something that borders somewhere between a worldview and a religion. For forty-five minutes we hear André's interesting but increasingly strange viewpoint as it goes from hipster oddness to kookiness to apocalyptic. For forty-five minutes, Wallace maintains his facade of polite conversation tricks. 

Here, the first time I viewed the movie, I paused it and went to the restroom. I was, to be honest, a little frustrated. So was Wallace, but his growing frustration is played very subtly, so I missed it the first time. I did not hold out hope for the rest of the movie. 

At close to the forty-five minute mark, Wallace's disinterested, polite facade starts to break down. Don't misunderstand me, the conversation remains polite and civil through out the entire movie. But Wallace decides he has to say something, and all the thoughts he's been really having through the whole movie (and that the audience has been having, or, at least, that I have been having) come out as well. 

Wallace starts embarrassed. The line goes something like: "Do you want to know what I think about that? What I really, really in my mind think about that? I can tell you what I think." He is, understandably, nervous about telling this old friend what he really thinks of this stuff. It's a scary thing telling a friend that he sounds like a lunatic, and finding a way to do it politely.
