I'm sitting on the flight back to Dallas and across the aisle is a thin, blonde women. She is wearing skin-tight leather pants, leather shoes, and a black turtle neck. Her hair is up in a braided bun.

She has an airplane book. I can tell it is an airplane book, because she started at page one after taking her seat. Her purse is open and inside are pink high heels. She is shaking her hand in front of her face once, twice, three times, trying to get the rose gold Apple Watch to activate.
