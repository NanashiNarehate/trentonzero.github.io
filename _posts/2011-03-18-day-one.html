<p>Above you can see a time lapse of the first day of development made with the open source program <a href="http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html">Gawker</a> and hosted on Youtube. Not much happened: I really  only had an hour today, but I should have more time tomorrow.</p>
<p>An important part of the game will be growing and shrinking clouds that will move across the map and, after they reach a certain point, rain. The rain will spawn the carnivorous plants for the player to deal with. Left to their own devices, clouds may very well rain directly in the middle of the player's base: not good. Players will need to use a combination of tools, from cloud seeding to wind turbines to other weather control devices to keep the rain (and the baddies) away from their base.</p>
<p>Today, I wrote the clouds. Clouds are assembled randomly from wisps that were drawn in GIMP. Even the smallest cloud consists of at least a dozen or so wisps, so it all adds up to clouds of quite varied shapes. Of course, they cast shadows on the things they pass over, so the player can know where the rain from the cloud would fall.</p>
<p>No rain yet. No baddies. Nothing remotely resembling a game.</p>
