<p>Today was a work day, so the only thing I really did today was get a WordPress site setup. I've been looking for an excuse to set aside a few hours and put up a personal website anyway.</p>
<p>So, look at me. I have a website. If those two sentences don't take you back to the 90's, I'm not sure what will.</p>
<p>Actual development should start Friday.</p>
