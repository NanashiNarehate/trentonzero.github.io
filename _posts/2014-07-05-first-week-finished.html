  mkd_text: "Today I finished my first week at my new job. To say it's a change is
    an understatement. I don't walk to talk trash about my former position. Indeed,
    I've had to rewrite this post three or four times because it kept turning into
    a bitch-fest about my last job, and I don't want it to be that. I like all the
    people at my last job, and I wish them all the best. But I almost feel like the
    new place was constructed consciously to alleviate the weaknesses of the old.
    \n \nBoth organizations are remarkably flat, and that serves as their greatest
    virtue. But management in the new place has a clear role and the team is confident
    they will fulfill it. The old place, not so much. I'm sure the new place has it's
    quirks. Every place does, but so far I'm a fan. \n\nI'm also more exhausted than
    normal at the end of the week. Right now, I'm writing that off as the extra stress
    of the first week on the job. I'm trying at every moment to make the best possible
    impression, even working overtime. The overtime isn't strictly necessary, but
    it doesn't hurt, first few weeks on the job, to be one of the first guys in the
    door and one of the last guys out. \n\nThat might not be all of it though. I did
    some reading about Agile/XP teams and have found more than one person saying not
    to be surprised if you are more exuasted than normal after a day of working in
    that environment. Counter-intuitively, even though the overall atmosphere at the
    job is very relaxed and casual, the pairing means that a person is less likely
    to slack off. Each side of the pair keeps each other honest and on-task."
