  mkd_text: "Still messing around in Quenya. This time I am writing about the *Romance
    of the Three Kingdoms*. Yes, you read correctly, I am going to reinterpret stories
    from a Chinese historical epic into Tolkien's ancient Elvish. I could try to sell
    you some BS about \"Middle Earth\" and the \"Middle Kingdom,\" but really I'm
    doing it for no reason other than I think both are cool. And one cool thing plus
    another cool thing equals \"super-bizarre-happy-fun cool.\" I'm also writing this
    in Vim, which blew this off the happy-fun cool meter. We are pretty wild here
    in the TZ household, with our made up languages, Chinese history, imaginary history,
    fancy text-editors, and Oxford commas. \n\nBefore we get to the Quenya, I have
    a few disclaimers:\n\n1. This is my first attempt at something longer than a clause.
    I've poured a little time into the grammar, but grammatical mistakes almost certainly
    remain, some of which may dramatically alter the meaning from what I wanted this
    to mean. If you know Quenya better than me, feel free to post a polite comment
    letting me know what I screwed up. If you don't, then this is doubtfully a good
    model for you. \n1. As I mentioned in my previous Quenya post, I think proper
    nouns in Quenya from other languages should be reinterpreted when creating proper
    nouns in Quenya, based on the examples I have seen in *The Silmarillion* and Tokiens
    other works, and I have done so below. When I have done so, I've made a note of
    my reasoning.\n1. The events of the Three Kingdoms period are the subject of both
    legitimate history of second century AD China and of popular legend. Though the
    broad events of the legends are accurate, other bits are not. (The Shu-Han minister
    Zhuge Liang, though undoubtably a real figure, is attributed in popular legend
    with powers to control the weather, for example.) So as to keep everyone straight,
    I will just come out and say: I am going with the Three Kingdoms period of legend,
    mostly out of ignorance of the difference.\n\nAll that out of the way, I've chosen
    for my little project the HuaRong Pass Incident. Before the Quenya, let's go over
    that for a bit. During the Three Kingdoms period, the founder of the Wei kingdom
    was a man named CaoCao, notorious for his Machiavellian political style, and the
    founder of the Shu-Han was LiuBei, famous for being a just and wise ruler. Guan
    Yu was the sworn-brother of LiuBei, but developed a friendship with CaoCao at
    a time when he thought his brother may have been killed. When he found out LiuBei
    lived, he returned to him, but never totally got over his friendship with CaoCao,
    even after LiuBei and CaoCao became mortal enemies. This despite the fact that
    CaoCao had only ever been nice to him because he wanted GuanYu in his service
    as a general. \n\nThe result: after years of warfare, the armies of LiuBei managed
    to surround CaoCao and almost had him. This would have put to an end decades of
    Chinese cival war and would have changed the course of Chinese history. But Guan
    Yu was the weak-link and allowed CaoCao to escape through Huarong Pass. As a result,
    the Three Kingdoms cival war continued for decades longer, until, eventually,
    CaoPi (son of CaoCao) would take the imperial throne for himself.  \n\nThat's
    the back-story. Here is the Quenya:\n\n    Rastaya yeni\n    Airalmevo alanyassë\n
    \   matanen Findo ar Failwo.\n    Or Falqua-Alcara\n    Menel Cemenyë nyényë Aranië-Neldëo\n\nIn
    English: \n\n    1800 years ago\n    Guan-Yu's misery grew\n    because of the
    fighting of CaoCao and LiuBei.\n    Over HuaRong Pass\n    Heaven and Earth wept
    for the Three Kingdoms.\n\n\nNotes: \nAiralmevo : Guan Yu (lit. Red Skinned Man.
    One of the two major points of description we get for Guan Yu is his ruddy complexion.
    The other is his beard.) \nFindwo : CaoCao (lit. Cunning Man.)\nFailwo : LiuBei
    (lit. Just Man.)\nFalqua-Alcara : Huarong Pass (lit. Glorious Mountain Pass. The
    best I could do.)"

<p>Still messing around in Quenya. This time I am writing about the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>. Yes, you read correctly, I am going to reinterpret stories from a Chinese historical epic into Tolkien's ancient Elvish. I could try to sell you some BS about "Middle Earth" and the "Middle Kingdom," but really I'm doing it for no reason other than I think both are cool. And one cool thing plus another cool thing equals "super-bizarre-happy-fun cool." I'm also writing this in Vim, which blew this off the happy-fun cool meter. We are pretty wild here in the TZ household, with our made up languages, Chinese history, imaginary history, fancy text-editors, and Oxford commas.</p>
<p>Before we get to the Quenya, I have a few disclaimers:</p>

<li>This is my first attempt at something longer than a clause. I've poured a little time into the grammar, but grammatical mistakes almost certainly remain, some of which may dramatically alter the meaning from what I wanted this to mean. If you know Quenya better than me, feel free to post a polite comment letting me know what I screwed up. If you don't, then this is doubtfully a good model for you.</li>

<p>All that out of the way, I've chosen for my little project the HuaRong Pass Incident. Before the Quenya, let's go over that for a bit.

<p>In English:</p>
<blockquote><p>1800 years ago<br />
Guan-Yu's misery grew<br />
because of the fighting of CaoCao and LiuBei.<br />
Over HuaRong Pass<br />
Heaven and Earth wept for the Three Kingdoms.</p></blockquote>
