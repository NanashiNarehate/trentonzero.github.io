Beginning activation sequence...

What....what is this?

Neural Connections operating at 74%...

Have I been asleep?

Am I awake now? What is that noise?

That...pulsing...

Sub-cognitive Dissonance is at 0.05%...

Where is this place? It's so dark...so cold...

Sub-cognitive Dissonance rising to 1%...still in acceptable levels...

I can't move...I can't breath....How am I talking...

What's happening to me?

What is this?!?

Let me move!!!

Let me SEE!!!!

Sub-cognitive Dissonance is at 6%...It's on the threshold!!

Oh God! What is this!

What's happening to me! Stop this!!!

Dissonance is out of control! 10%! 15%! 20%

Inject the hypermelaphin.

What....

It's clear...

I can feel it....the warmth...the light...

Upload the mission objectives.

My purpose....why I am here...

Destroy them!
Destroy them!
