title: What Motivates You?
---
We were sitting talking with a family friend a few weeks ago when the topic of the conversation turned to the source of our motivation. Everyone else had an answer, but I didn't have one ready at hand.

It would be easy to say God, but it wouldn't be true, except maybe in a very technical, theological sense. The role of God in my life is largely that of providing bumpers. 

God, through the Catholic Church, through my wife, through the Bible, and through watching and thinking on the actions of Christians around me, tells me when I'm veering a little two far in one direction or the other. 

Maybe that's not the role God should play, but it's the role He's playing now. But I can't honestly say that I'm trying to be a better programmer for God. Or that I'm out jogging for God. Or that I'm trying to secure my financial independence for God. 

It would be easy to say my wife. But it wouldn't be true. I love her, she's the best thing that ever happened to me other than my baptism. But I'm not jogging for her. We're not saving money for her. In fact, it scares the bejesus out of me that I haven't been called upon to suffer for her yet. Suffering. Now there's a point. 

I fell in the trap that I identified with perfect and total clarity twenty years ago. I found myself making a six-figure salary and in debt and with a sob story to tell myself about why there never seemed to be enough. And I was fat, that was the part of the trap I didn't see twenty years ago. Liswamire tried on and off to warn me on that one, but she was in it herself. And maybe that's a lesson in life? No one can show you the trap. You have to see it yourself, or you don't see it at all. 

I want out of the trap. We make enough that the money one is easy, once you see the trap. Half our income goes into saving or extra principle payments on our two remaining debts (a car payment and our mortgage.) 

The weight one is harder. I have a budget spreadsheet and it isn't hard to follow. I also have some weight related spreadsheets, but nothing really special. I'm leveraging Fitbit and Strava alot here, but starting to chafe under their ecosystems, so I'm probably going to port some to a spreadsheet.
