 As I grow older, more of my life consists of echoes. I am sitting in the same coffeeshop where I sat and had my first really good coffee, where the prostitute solicited me, where I sat in a corner and sobbed over my Ent-wife, where I wrote half my best myths in a caffeinated haze, where I have seen three owner manager coffee-affianadoes come and go, and where I bristled with stupid, sophomoric pride when a community college philosophy adjunct expressed approval of my reading choices. Where I brought Kelly Wojtas, the cute young widow, to try good coffee and also to try the idea of a date far too soon after Amber was gone. That didn't work out, but then it couldn't have, because she was not Laura and I was not yet me again.

That's my coffeeshop, and it's everything true about localism, distributism, Wendell Berry and Chesterton, and the evils of modernity. The only really true antiAmericanism and antiliberalism. It's the rule of life of which Fr Hawkins spoke and the secret of happiness, to find a place and go there everyday, and thereby reenchant the world.
