There once was a man,
named Pete Bushumo.
He lived in a house on bubblegum lane.
This little man
named Pete Bushumo
loved bubblegum
and he loved the arcade.

Well this little man
named Pete Bushumo
was walking down the street.
Headin for arcades
headin for gum
headin for trouble
and someone to meet.

Now, the person he met
was named Kitty Bordan
she was the fastest gun in the East.
She came from China
and she liked Tom Brocaw
and she shot little Pete
right there in the street.

Little Pete Bushumo
was sad to die
he went to meet his maker
he went to the sky


Singing, ----
"Heeeyyy...
Kitty Bordan!
Why'd you shoot me
in my head?"

Say it, ----
"Heeeyyy...
Kitty Bordan!
You shot me and
now I'm dead!"
