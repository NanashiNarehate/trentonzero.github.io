<p>I gave Orëveriel a hard time about the the whole shaving fiasco as reported in my previous record. I even went so far as to say that practically every foolish thing I had ever done, I had done on her council. </p>
<p>In Orëveriel's defense, occasionally, randomly almost, she gets things correct. And, often, these are the times I choose not to listen to her. This morning, for example. </p>
<p>Orëveriel was in her usual spot in the middle of the living room. Only, this time she was a giant calico cat. A six foot long calico cat. And did I mention she was wearing a neon orange rain jacket. This detail was difficult to miss. </p>

<p>I had not even put on my glasses, or changed into my work clothes, or brushed my teeth, when she said, "You should drive to work today." </p>
<p>I was still sore at her, so I ignored this suggestion and went about my normal morning routine, which now, tragically, included an obligatory morning shave. As I left the bathroom, holding a towel on my face, she had moved to stand, blocking the door, on her hind legs, paws on hips, bent at the waist. </p>
<p>"You really, really should drive to work today." </p>
<p>I lost it. </p>
<p>"Just like I really should shave? Really should grow mutton-chops? Really, really ought to go work in Mexico? No thanks. I can screw up my own life without your help." A tad melodramatic but that did the trick. She said something along the lines of "You sure can" and took her leave. </p>
<p>I took the train to work, like I always do, and everything went swell, until I left. </p>
<p>Turns out, there was a thunder and hail storm while I was at work. And all the trains were just sitting there, on the tracks, doing nothing for about an hour and half after I got off work. I am only just now coming within 10 minutes of the train station near my home, having left the office nearly three hours before. Giving up on the trains Dallas inner-city trains, I walked 3 miles to the transfer point for the TRE, which thankfully was only about a half hour behind schedule. </p>
<p>Sitting next to me on the train is Orëveriel, a six-foot tall erect calico cat, wearing a now soaked rain-coat and sipping hot tea (I know not from where) from a porcelian tea cup (from I know not where.) She hasn't said anything yet. She just looks at me, with the smug superiority that seems to always on the face of all cats. </p>
<p>I no longer look like me. I look like a very cold, very wet baby. And she, as a smug, self-satisified cat with a silent "told you so" expression, looks like no one except Orëveriel. </p>
