title: Fat Nerd 2 Not Stupid
---

Everyone has a fitness philosophy it seems like, but I'm not sure I've really heard anyone express mine. Maybe that's because I'm wrong (disclaimer, I still weigh almost 260 pounds). Or maybe that's because I don't have anything to sell you. Anyway, here's mine, the "Don't be Stupid" fitness program.

<!-- more -->

1. Any "diet" that tells you that you can lose weight without running a reasonable calorie deficit is stupid. Don't be stupid.  

2. Lying to yourself about your calories is stupid. The calories are an abstraction designed to help you understand how your body is keeping score. They are not the score. Thinking they are the score is stupid. Don't be stupid.

3. Starving yourself to death to lose weight is stupid. You need food to live. Don't be stupid.

4. Sticking your finger down your throat is stupid. There's literal acid in your stomach, and your throat wasn't designed to touch that stuff more than a few times in your lifetime. Don't be stupid.

5. Refusing to exercise is stupid. Your body is designed to move. Don't be stupid. 

6. Injuring yourself with your exercise is stupid. Don't be stupid. 

7. Refusing to take rest days and injuring yourself is stupid. Don't be stupid.

8. Comparing your exercise to others who do not have your body is stupid. Don't be stupid.

9. Fitness reality TV is stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid, evil, stupid. Don't be stupid.

10. Any diet that does not reduce in some way to you calorie counting is stupid and probably evil. Don't be stupid.

11. Any diet that tells you don't need something that humans have been eating, in good health, for thousands of years, is stupid. You need carbs, protein, fats, a dozen different vitamins and minerals, and who knows what else we haven't even discovered is essential in food to live. Chesterton's fence applies here with a vengeance. Humans have been successfully eating for the entire existence of humanity. If someone came up with it last week, it either reduces to what humans have been doing anyway, or it's stupid.  Don't be stupid.

12. Therefore, Atkins, paleo, health (as opposed to religiously) motivated veganism, Jenny Craig, and Slimfast are stupid.  WeightWatchers is not stupid, but only because it is basically "calorie counting with peer pressure."

13. Thinking you can optimize this is stupid. You need a wide variety of types of food, you need varied exercise, and you need to run a calorie deficit.
