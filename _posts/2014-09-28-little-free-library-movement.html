    Amber and I at the nearest Little Free Library in Oakhurst, Texas.[/caption] \n\nThis
    weekend's discovery, thanks to [lovely wife, Amber](http://www.amberrollins.com),
    is the [Little Free Library](http://littlefreelibrary.org) movement. The gist
    of this is that a family or community group puts a weather-proofed box (think
    of a mailbox, but bigger) on a post by the curb with a sign that invites people
    to  \"Take a book, leave a book.\" A typical Little Free Library holds about two
    shelves, each with about a dozen or so books on them, and it essentially operates
    on the honor system that for every book you take, you will drop off another book.
    And, naturally, each Little Free Library has a patron (usually the person that
    put it on their front lawn, but often a neighborhood home owner's association
    or some such group) that is responsible for ensuring that it stays stocked and
    in decent repair. Again it's all honor system, but the expectation is that patrons
    will drop the book off at the same (or another) Library when they have finished
    it. \n\nThe head organization that sets all this up sells ready-made boxes for
    anyone that just wants to put one up in their yard, but does nothing to require
    a group to use one of their boxes. And they are, I confess, a bit over-priced.
    They do ask for a $40 one-time fee in order to join the official list of Little
    Free Libraries and be placed on the [map](http://littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap/)
    so that others can find your stop. \n\nI would be lying if I didn't say we are
    tempted to put up one of our own. So far, there are only half a dozen or so in
    the Fort Worth area (with another dozen or so in the Dallas area). We visited
    the nearest one (which is only about two miles away), but it's actually in a poor
    location at the end of a cul-de-sac in a posh neighborhood. We, on the other hand,
    are directly across the street from an elementary school on a street that gets
    lots of foot and bicycle traffic. \n\nOn a blogging-related side note, I have
    finally figured out how to attach images to a post and still have the post behave
    in VimRepress (a plugin for the Vim text editor that integrates with WordPress
    blogs.)"
