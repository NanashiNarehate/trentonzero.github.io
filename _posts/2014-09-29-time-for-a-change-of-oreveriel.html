    The influence of Orëveriel [/caption]\n\nI've had a beard in various states of
    grisliness for the past two years or so. I have been a beard guy primarily out
    of laziness. One less daily ritual to perform in the morning, five minutes more
    to do things I'd rather do. That or sleep. Either way. \n\nLast night, I was visited
    by an old friend whom I had not seen in a while. In order to protect the innocent,
    I will just refer to her by her Elvish name: Orëveriel. She seems to prefer that
    name lately anyway. And no, it's not Amber. You are being too literal, and besides,
    she's Liswamírë. Do keep track of the semi-arbitrary imaginary names I've started
    assigning to people in the past week or so, if you would. Liswamírë was actually
    quietly opposed. \n\nThe conversation actually went something like this: \n\nOrëveriel
    said \"You know, Vanyánan, you haven't shaved in a really long time.\" \n\nShe
    said this while doing a hand-stand in the center of the room. This has always
    been her favorite place. The hand-stand had been her favorite posture of late,
    though she changes favorite postures relatively often. Her favorite posture last
    week was standing on one foot while touching her nose with both ring-fingers,
    fanning the rest of her fingers out over her face. That one was actually subtly
    disturbing, so Liswamírë and I were both somewhat relieved when she decided she
    preferred hand-stands this week. \n\nI hesitated. I knew Liswamírë preferred me
    to be bearded, and I also knew, well, how to put this nicely? Orëveriel is well-meaning,
    but her suggestions have a checkered history. She had suggested I take up an interest
    in Quenya, which has proved fun enough, and is certainly the most enthusiastic
    on the subject of all the people I know (though her enthusiasms are short-lived.)
    She had also suggested I join two book-clubs at work, even knowing how particular
    my tastes are. I'm actually not certain Orëveriel is so well-meaning, come to
    think of it. Most of the stupid things I have done in my life, I have done inspired
    by her council. \n\n\"Maybe I should just trim it.\" I offered as a compromise.
    \n\nLiswamírë leapt at that, \"Yes, just a trim.\" \n\n\"No, not drastic enough.
    You want people to notice the change, don't you, Vanyánan?\" To emphasize her
    point, Orëveriel shifted her weight onto her right-hand and touched the tip of
    her nose with the ring finger on her left-hand, staring out at me between index
    and middle fingers. Liswamírë and I certainly noticed the threat to return to
    her previous favored pose. \n\n\"Actually...\" I began, taking the hint. \n\nLiswamírë
    was made of harder stuff. \"She's baiting you.\"\n\n\"...a change does sound like
    a good idea.\" \n\n\"You'll regret it. You won't look like you.\" \n\n\"That's
    true...\" I considered.\n\nOrëveriel scoffed, \"Oh please. Who will you look like
    then? How could a person ever not look like themselves. A person has to look like
    themselves, by definition. That's just plain logic. A=A and all that. After all,
    I change my appearance *all the time*, and I always look exactly like me.\" This
    was true. At that time, Orëveriel had a distinctly pixieish look, with boyishly
    short black-hair. Not three days prior, she had been a tall blonde. Two weeks
    ago, she was a he, and not a very attractive looking he at at that. Yet one thing
    was certainly true, Orëveriel never ceased to look like herself, no matter what
    form she took. \n\nThat bit of sophistry settled it. \"I will shave it all off.\"
    \n\nLiswamírë knew when the battle was over and shrugged, \"If you must...\"\n\nFifteen
    minutes and a trash can full of hair later, I found an alien face staring out
    at me from the mirror. You wouldn't think a beard could matter, but after a while,
    I don't know how long, it becomes part of your self-image, your identity, part
    of who you are. This morning, when I woke up, I shaved to clean up the stubble
    that had grown over night, and packed my lunch. That sounds ordinary, but I never
    pack my lunch. It's...just not me. This morning I packed my lunch. I spent my
    time on the train writing a *fictional* blog post. Another very un-me-ish thing
    to do. \n\nI arrived at work, and everyone greeted me as Kevin, rather than Vanyánan,
    and kept making references to a \"brother\" that works for the same company. I
    laughed, and decided that I needed to schedule the meetings that accompany each
    block of work, and felt happy about it. Since when was I happy about meetings?
    I considered it as I sipped my Earl Grey tea, which I never drank before, but
    which now seemed the only natural morning beverage. \n\nBefore long, it was lunch
    time, and I went off by myself and decided to get some writing done, rather than
    read, or eat at my desk, or eat with my fellow Android developer Yulmo. I wasn't
    able to get much writing done, though, because Orëveriel had apparently followed
    me to work, and soon plopped herself into the seat in front of me at the cafeteria,
    feet propped up on the formaldehyde table. Her hair was now shoulder-length and
    had streaks of pink, purple, and blue. \n\nI looked at her in sore silence.  \n\nShe
    returned the stare, looking bemused, for two or three seconds before glancing
    away.\n\n\"Okay, I admit it. That was too much at once. Something is missing.
    You need...something...\" A sudden spark of inspiration lit her face. She dropped
    her feet to the floor and slammed her hands on the table.  \n\n\"I know! Mutton-chops!\""
