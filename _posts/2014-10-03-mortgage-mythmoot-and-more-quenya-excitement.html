    Tolkien has poor female characters? Remember, it's Luthien who beats up Sauron,
    not Beren. [(Art by n924@DeviantArt)](http://n924.deviantart.com/art/Luthien-defeats-Sauron-372188227)
    [/caption] \n\nThis was an exciting week at the TZ household. The biggest piece
    of news is that our mortgage application is moving forward. I don't pretend to
    really understand the entire process, but we are passing through multiple stages
    of Wells Fargo's approval process for a home loan. Today, we mailed out the paperwork
    for a yet more specific application. If everything keeps going as its going, Liswamírë
    and I may actually own a house pretty soon, and, here's the odd part, Wells Fargo's
    latest communications to me suggest that my total mortgage will be lower than
    my rent. Of course, it kind of stands to reason that such a thing would happen,
    but it sure does make renting seem like a sucker deal. \n\nAll that's plenty dramatic,
    but there's still more. Liswamírë and I have each been invited to speak at Mythmoot
    this January.  Liswamírë and I each submitted a paper for the conference. We were
    apparently two out of over a hundred submissions, and we made the short list.
    How did that happen? No idea. She submitted some cool, smarty-pants linguistics
    thing about how the characters in *Clockwork Orange* illustrate the Sapir-Whorf
    Hypothesis. And I submitted some thing about *Book of the New Sun* and *Man Who
    Fell to Earth.* Am I bit intimidated? Yeah, a bit. But excited as well.\n\nAnd,
    in the Quenya realm, we were at Half Price Books today and we found \"The Lost
    Road and Other Writings\" from Christopher Tolkien's \"History of Middle Earth\"
    series. This volume five of a series of twelve books assembled by JRR Tolkien's
    son containing Tolkien's notes and plans and stories about Middle Earth. This
    one in particular is especially exciting because it contains the text of \"The
    Entymologies.\" That is, Tolkien's entymology for the Quenya language. And yes,
    I have already used it to spot glaring problems in some of the Quenya writing
    I have done so far. (Such as not really knowing the purpose of the -iel at the
    end of many feminine names, but using it anyway.) \n\nFinally, also at Half Price,
    I got a copy of the \"Lays of Beleriand\" (volume three from History of Middle
    Earth) which contains, among other things, the full text of the \"Lay of Leithien,\"
    a poetic telling of my favorite story from *The Silmarillion*, the story of Beren
    and Luthien."
