<p>Yes, I skipped one. Long story short, I never wrote an entry for three, but I don't want to get my posts out of sync with the time lapse videos, so this is now 4.</p>
<p>I managed to get a few hours in on it this morning, so I spent the time working on the button bar where the player will select towers to lay down and actions to perform. Also drew terrible graphics for the cloud seeder button, just so I have something to look at when I am testing it.</p>
<p>Getting closer to having all the basic building blocks of the game assembled. Probably next time I sit down, I will be able to start putting them together and there will be something resembling game play to show off. Right now, I have a simulation of clouds moving across the screen while growing, shrinking, and raining called 'CloudTest' and just a fast program called 'ButtonBarTest' that loads and displays a button bar.</p>
