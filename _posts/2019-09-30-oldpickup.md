I remember being a child, sitting in my Papa's old GMC pickup. It was the one with two gas tanks. That's what I remember, blue and white and it had two gas tanks. I had a giant streetmap of the US, and I was planning my transcontinental road trip. And I knew, with perfect clarity and faith, that with Papa's truck and two gas tanks, I could do it.

People post about #adulting when they want to talk about responsibilities. They are so wrong. #adulting is that you now know a road trip with no destination is ridiculous and tiresome, and that two gas tanks is an absurdity. And you also know, just as much, that somewhere that knowledge missed something pretty important. And you just can't put your finger on what it is, but it's 8:45 and you need to finish the ride to work.
