The voice has told me I should kill all of you.

It screams at me in my dreams.

It whispers it in my ears during my waking hours.

Then the black outs come...

I lose hours of time...

I wake up in strange places...

Covered in blood....

I'm filled with guilt most of the time...

But the rest of the time...

Like right now....

I like it.

I like it alot.

...

Just thought I'd let you know.
