<p>Liswamírë and I took a trip to Gateway Park today and went on a nice four-mile hike with Merry and Pippin. </p>
<p>Autumn is definitely the best season of the year. It has this entire "winding down" feel to it that I like. The temperatures are pleasant, but the wind is starting to get a cold bite to it. Just enough to wear a jacket and pull it tighter when it picks up. Nature takes on a tone of wistful, melancholic reflection, and that suits me just fine. It is time for coffee and acoustic music. And poetry. It is doubtful a coincidence that I took up blogging and poetry again in the fall. It wasn't conscious, I assure you, but it fits, and I think there is a cause-and-effect going on there somewhere in the subconscious. </p>
