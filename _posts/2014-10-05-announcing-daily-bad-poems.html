  mkd_text: "When I was in high-school, freshman year, I took creative writing, and
    the bulk of the writing was poetry. (Or maybe that is just what I remember best.)
    I wrote poetry through all of high-school and even a few years after. Then, I
    just stopped. \n\nI realized something which was probably obvious to everyone
    else from the start, namely that I am not a very good poet. My poems that weren't
    teenage angst or Pythonesque gibberish were obvious and without any of the real
    insight that makes for great poetry. Even then, most of the time I just hacked
    it and tried to assume other writer's insights and rephrase them in my own words.
    My sense of meter, when I was disciplined enough to follow it, which was very
    rarely, was barely tolerable. \n\nI was a bad poet, and I felt that if I couldn't
    be a good poet, I may as well give the whole thing up. (It wasn't long after giving
    up poetry that I gave up prose as well.) Besides, I was getting into my mid-twenties
    by this point and the whole thing just seemed too juvenile. No one besides myself
    was to blame for this. I think I was just a late bloomer and committed that most
    juvenile of juvenile offenses: trying to act like an adult. \n\nCut to today,
    I'm in my mid-thirties, and anyone that questions my adulthood and can get in
    line behind the mortgage and the two car payments. I promise to call their number
    sometime in, oh, thirty-years. \n\nAfter not writing a poem in a decade or so,
    a few months ago I wrote a [short haiku about a spider](/2014/07/12/spider-at-the-door/)
    that took up residence outside my front-door. It wasn't anything special, but
    I liked writing it, so I wrote a few more. And a few more after that. Many [downright
    terrible](/2014/10/05/daily-poem-1/), others... better.\n\nI have come full circle
    and have decided that I just don't care anymore that my poetry is bad (provided
    it's as good as I could compose it.) I am not a famous poet, so I have no one
    to please but myself and a narrow circle of friends. I have a career where I get
    to be serious and competent, five-days a week. I can be silly, juvenile, and incompetent
    in my spare time if it suits me. \n\nAll that being said, I've decided that I
    will post one poem, good or (more likely) bad or (likelier still) terrible. The
    best I can promise is that none of them will be deliberately bad. I will never
    write a worse poem than I could write at the time, but that is the limit of my
    guarantee of quality, and there will be no returns. *Caveat emptor*."
